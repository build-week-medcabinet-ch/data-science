# Medicine Cabinet

The Medicine Cabinet aims to connect cannabis consumers with a strain perfect for their needs. This repo contains our core dataset and an API ready to connect to a full-stack web app.


## Dataset

Our dataset consists of a couple thousand strains. Each strain is associated with a type, rating, list of effects, list of flavors, a brief description, and a list of the strains most similar to it based on a nearest neighbors model. 

## API

Our API allows a user to input desired effects and returns an ideal strain from the dataset.
